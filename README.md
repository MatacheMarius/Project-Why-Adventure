### About the project:

WHY ADVENTURE is an app for travelers who want a more unique,
local experience in their next holiday or getaway.
Within the application, you can browse destinations
and view pertinent travel information. Once you know where you want to go
it is time to pick your dates, and move on to guide selection. 
The platform creates an easy interface for users to connect
with locals where they’d like to go.

This app is a React based app with a MondoDB.
